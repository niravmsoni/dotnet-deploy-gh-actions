# Configuring Dependabot
In this post, we'll go over how can we automate Project dependency updates for .NET Applications

## Problem statement
In the software development ecosystem, there's a common saying: "Don't reinvent the wheel." When building .NET applications, our primary focus as developers should be on solving the core problems at hand. Often, for common challenges, there are already existing solutions in the form of packages on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/). All we need to do is pick the appropriate version and integrating it into our solution. This can significantly accelerate our development.

However, each coin has 2 sides. As soon as we decide to integrate any existing packages within our solution, we're adding a Technical Debt to our solution.
In my experience, after adding dependencies, most of the developers do not regularly check for updated versions of their dependencies. 
The dependencies (Specifically versions) are often looked at when:
- Upgrading the framework version (e.g., from .NET Core 6 to .NET Core 8) forces a dependency update.
- A [NuGet scan step](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/concepts/auditing-packages) in your CI pipeline reports a vulnerability.
In these cases, developers reactively review and update their dependencies.

Is there a better way to handle this problem proactively?

## Enter Dependabot
- [Dependabot](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/working-with-dependabot) is a bot that integrates with GitHub and helps us update the dependency of our solutions
- For enabling Dependabot support for your repository, go to Settings tab and you'll find a section namely "Code Security and analysis" where you'll find Dependabot related configurations

- Let's look at what this individual options do:
  - Enable `Dependabot alerts` - For receiving notifications regarding dependabot either in GitHub   notifications or over Emails
  - Enable `Dependabot security updates` - Using this, Dependabot can find out vulnerabilities which are exposed and it can alert us
  - Enable `Dependabot version updates` - Using this, we can enable the version updates for dependencies (For example - A new version for `coverlet.collector` is available on NuGet (6.0.2) and our code is using an older version (6.0.0), then we can use option to enable version updates
